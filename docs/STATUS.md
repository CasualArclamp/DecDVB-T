# Status

Running log of what is done and what is next. `docs/DESIGN.md` holds the plan.

## Kickoff (2026-10-23)

- Folder created, scope agreed in Q&A (see DESIGN.md §1).

## M0 — skeleton (2026-10-23)

Rust 1.99.1 (stable MSVC) installed with rustup (winget). The workspace
builds, its 114 tests pass, and clippy (`-D warnings`) and rustfmt are clean.

Copied from DecSAT and renamed `decsat-*` → `decdvbt-*`, with the satellite
parts cut out:

- `decdvbt-core`: as in DecSAT, plus **`channel`** (new): the UHF raster
  (C21 = 474 MHz … C69), the UK list (21–48 less 38), channel parsing
  ("C34"). The S2 MODCOD/FECFRAME types remain only because the LDPC/BCH use
  them; T2's own types replace them in M6.
- `decdvbt-dsp`: DDC, FIR, SIMD dot product, AGC, DC blocker. Gone: RRC,
  Gardner timing, the carrier PLL (single-carrier only).
- `decdvbt-io`: IQ files (cs8/cs16/cf32, WAV), HackRF RX/TX behind
  `--features hackrf`. Unchanged.
- `decdvbt-fec`: DecSAT's LDPC + BCH (T2 uses the same codes) as they were,
  plus **`conv`** (K = 7 Viterbi, punctured rates) and **`rs`**
  (RS(204,188)), taken from `decsat-modem`. Both match DVB-T's outer and
  inner codes (EN 300 744 §4.3.2–4.3.3).
- `decdvbt-ts`: PSI/SI analyser, sections, sinks (file/UDP/TCP-HTTP), the
  keyframe backlog, UDP-in-TS finding. Gone: BBFRAME deframing, MPE, BISS/CSA,
  DVB-RCS, Newtec, uplink ID. `serve` moved in from `decsat-ip`.
- `decdvbt-audio`: cut down to the PCM player and resampler (ffmpeg decodes
  everything). Gone: multicast depacketising, Symphonia, libxaac, libopus,
  and so both `-sys` crates and the git submodules (and CMake).
- `decdvbt-video`: the ffmpeg TV player. Unchanged.
- `decdvbt-cli` (new, binary `decdvbt`): `channels`, `channel C34|578`.

Left in DecSAT: engine, GUI, GSE, IP, frame, modem (except conv/rs), mod.
CI is copied with the submodule/CMake steps removed; the release workflow
comes with the GitHub repo.

Not done in M0: the GUI app (comes with the waterfall in M1), the GitHub
repo (needs `gh` or a manual create; private, per kickoff), no commit yet.

**Next (M1):** HackRF/Airspy/file front end into a spectrum + waterfall
GUI, channel tuning, IQ recorder, per-stage CPU meter; first captures.
